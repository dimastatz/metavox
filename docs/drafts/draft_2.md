# MetaVox Now Available: A Python Library to Transform Slides into Narrated Videos with Ease
Today, we are excited to announce the immediate availability of **MetaVox**, a new open-source Python library that enables developers and content creators to convert slides and speaker notes into fully narrated videos effortlessly. Inspired by tools like Narakeet, MetaVox delivers a powerful, programmatic solution for creating dynamic video content directly within Python environments, empowering users to automate and scale their workflows.

MetaVox simplifies the process of turning static presentations into engaging videos. Customers can upload slides in common formats (such as PowerPoint, PDF, or images), pair them with text like speaker notes, and generate high-quality MP4 videos with natural-sounding narration—all with just a few lines of Python code. Whether building e-learning courses, automating business presentations, or producing tutorials, MetaVox offers a flexible, code-driven approach to video creation.

> “MetaVox makes it easy for developers to bring their slides to life with narration, without leaving the Python ecosystem,” said [Your Name], Lead Developer for MetaVox. “By combining open-source accessibility with robust text-to-speech and slide-sync capabilities, we’re giving customers a scalable way to create video content on their terms.”

## Key Capabilities

- **Text-to-Speech Narration**: Transform speaker notes into professional voiceovers with over 500 voice options across 80+ languages.
- **Slide Integration**: Seamlessly import slides from PPTX, PDF, or image files and sync them with narration timing.

- **Local Processing**: Run MetaVox on Windows, macOS, or Linux with no reliance on external services.
- **Open-Source**: Available at no cost, with source code on GitHub for community contributions.
